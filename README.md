# A-Cross-category-Fault-Diagnosis-by-deep-Few-shot-Learning
    Recently, due to the increasing demand for intelligent machinery fault diagnosis with strong versatility,
    research on data-driven fault diagnosis has been achieved some achievements. However, the problem of fault
    diagnosis cross-category space has not been solved effectively. Therefore, inspired by the theory of few-
    shot learning, we propose a Cross-category Fault Diagnosis based on Deep Few-shot Learning (CFDFL). The
    proposed method to identify the health states of mechanical component B(MCB) with the help of the diagnosis
    knowledge from mechanical component A(MCA) to achieve cross-category space fault classification. Moreover,
    distance factors and parameter weighting factors are defined to help the model learn accurate
    classification boundaries by expanding the inter-class distance and narrowing the intra-class distances.
    The performance of the proposed method is verified by eight cross-category fault diagnosis experiments on
    three datasets. The results show that even with few labeled data for fault components, the fault diagnosis
    model has a satisfactory classification accuracy for new class samples without changing the existing model.
