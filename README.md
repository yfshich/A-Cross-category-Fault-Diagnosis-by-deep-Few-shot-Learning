# A-Cross-category-Fault-Diagnosis-by-deep-Few-shot-Learning
    Recently, due to the increasing demand for intelligent machinery fault diagnosis with strong versatility, research on data-driven fault diagnosis has been achieved some achievements. However, the problem of fault diagnosis cross-category space has not been solved effectively. Therefore, inspired by the theory of few-shot learning, we propose a Cross-category Fault Diagnosis based on Deep Few-shot Learning (CFDFL). The proposed method to identify the health states of mechanical component B(MCB) with the help of the diagnosis knowledge from mechanical component A(MCA) to achieve cross-category space fault classification. Moreover, distance factors and parameter weighting factors are defined to help the model learn accurate classification boundaries by expanding the inter-class distance and narrowing the intra-class distances. The performance of the proposed method is verified by eight cross-category fault diagnosis experiments on three datasets. The results show that even with few labeled data for fault components, the fault diagnosis model has a satisfactory classification accuracy for new class samples without changing the existing model.
